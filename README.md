# Kiits

Kiits makes requests to the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) to collect information about Reddit's users and submissions.

Kiits is part of Raofu, the Reddit brigading detection system. Kiits is a task runner, it performs all the heavy lifting that would take too long for [Rednant](https://github.com/kittsville/Randant).

Raofu is based on the Reddit brigading detection system described in Maywood (2017).
